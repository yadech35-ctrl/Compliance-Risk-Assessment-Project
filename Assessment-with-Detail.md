- **Impact**: Fines, reputational damage, operational errors.  
- **Action Plan**:  
  - Introduce annual refresher courses with case studies.  
  - Track completion rates via HR system.  
  - Run short scenario-based workshops.  

### R5: Phishing Attack Leading to Data Breach
- **Why critical**: Smaller firms are frequent targets of phishing and social engineering.  
- **Impact**: Customer data exposure, FCA investigation, reputational harm.  
- **Action Plan**:  
  - Quarterly staff awareness campaigns.  
  - Enforce multi-factor authentication for all accounts.  
  - Maintain an incident response checklist.

## 6. Reflection
This project was developed as a **learning exercise** to apply structured risk assessment methods to a compliance scenario.  

**Key takeaways:**  
- Compliance issues are not only regulatory but also **operational** (training, documentation).  
- Risk management requires **continuous monitoring**, not one-off actions.  
- Smaller firms face **resource constraints**, so mitigation must be proportionate.  
- The process deepened my understanding of how compliance risks link to day-to-day business practice.  

While based on a fictional company, the exercise improved my ability to identify, prioritise, and propose realistic responses to compliance risks.
